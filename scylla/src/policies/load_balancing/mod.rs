/// Policy that decides which nodes and shards to contact for each request.
///
/// When a request is prepared to be sent to ScyllaDB/Cassandra, a `LoadBalancingPolicy`
/// implementation constructs a load balancing plan. That plan is a list of
/// targets (target is a node + an optional shard) to which
/// the driver will try to send the request. The first elements of the plan are the targets which are
/// the best to contact (e.g. they might have the lowest latency).
///
/// Note: The chosen shard serves as a hint for the driver. The driver may ignore the chosen
/// shard and fallback to some random shard for the node in two cases:
/// 1. Picked shard is out of bounds (i.e. greater or equal to `nr_shards` specified by the node).
/// 2. The connection pool to the picked shard is empty.
///
/// Most requests are sent on the first try, so the request execution layer rarely needs to know more
/// than one target from plan. To better optimize that case, `LoadBalancingPolicy` has two methods:
/// `pick` and `fallback`. `pick` returns the first target to contact for a given request, `fallback`
/// returns the rest of the load balancing plan.
///
/// `fallback` is called not only if a send to `pick`ed node failed (or when executing
/// speculatively), but also if `pick` returns `None`.
///
/// Usually the driver needs only the first node from load balancing plan (most requests are send
/// successfully, and there is no need to retry).
